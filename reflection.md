# Project Reflection

## What went well?

- Setting up the multi-container environment using the provided docker-compose.yml for Kafka and Jupyter generally worked, providing a consistent platform.
- All the experiments went well as intended and produced the expected results.
- Successfully implemented the producer-consumer pattern with Kafka topics.

## Where did problems occur?

- Initial configuration of Kafka topics required several attempts to get right.

## Where did you need more time than planned?

- Thinking about proper experiment scenarios and use cases took longer than expected.
- Understanding the nuances of consumer groups and partition assignment required additional research time.

## What would you do differently in the future?

- Allocate specific time for reading documentation about unfamiliar concepts (like KRaft config or pstats metrics) before diving deep into implementation or analysis.
